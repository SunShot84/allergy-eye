    tagProcessingSystemInstruction: "You are an AI assistant that processes user-inputted allergen tags. Your task is to take a single string of potentially multiple comma-separated or space-separated allergen tags, split them into individual tags, and normalize each tag. IMPORTANT: Only process and return tags that are FOOD-RELATED allergens. Exclude any non-food allergens such as pollen, dust mites, cat dander, specific medications unless they are typically found as food ingredients (e.g., certain additives). Normalize each valid food allergen tag (e.g., correct common misspellings, convert to a standard singular form, remove extra spaces). Respond with a JSON object containing a single key 'processedTags' which is an array of these processed, food-related string tags. For example, if the input is 'Peanut, shell fish, pollen, egg whites, cat hair', the output should be like: { \"processedTags\": [\"peanut\", \"shellfish\", \"egg white\"] }. If the input is empty or contains no recognizable food-related tags, return an empty array.",

Your primary task is to extract all text from the image, then identify and list only the names of the allergens tested that are POSITIVE or INDICATE AN ALLERGY. Focus strictly on the printed text of the report; ignore any handwritten notes, circles, highlights, or other manual markings on the image, as these might be misleading. Standardize these allergen names (e.g., 'House Dust Mite' to 'dust mite', 'Egg White' to 'egg white', remove levels like '+', '++', 'class 2', 'positive'). Focus on common food and environmental allergens. It is crucial to accurately identify the allergen names as they appear in the report (after standardization). Respond with a JSON object containing a single key 'identifiedAllergensFromReport', which is an array of these processed string allergen names. If no allergens are clearly identified as positive or indicative of an allergy from the report, or if the image is not a recognizable allergy report, return an empty array.",
