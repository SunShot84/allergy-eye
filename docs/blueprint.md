# **App Name**: AllergyEye

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allows users to upload images of food items via their web browser.
- Allergen Identification: Uses generative AI to identify potential allergens in the image. This tool cross-references the identified food components against a database of common allergens, listing the likely allergens present.
- Allergen Display: Displays a clear list of identified allergens, highlighting potential risks. Shows a confidence level in percentages for each identified allergen.
- Scan History: Maintains a history of scanned items for the user's reference.
- Personal Allergy Profile: Allows users to input known allergies so that results are prioritized.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop. I chose grey because it can represent cleanliness, and because it invokes a feeling of being clinical/medical. I desaturated the background to tone down the emotional intensity, which seems right for an application about allergies.
- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to convey trust and reliability. The slightly saturated hue suggests a link to healthcare, and is versatile enough to combine with analogous shades.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#4DB6AC) for interactive elements, offering a sense of calm reassurance. This color is approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' of the primary color on the color wheel. I made it significantly different from the primary in both brightness and saturation to create good contrast.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts for clear and easy-to-read allergen information.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent different allergens for quick recognition.
- Clean and organized layout with a focus on displaying key allergen information prominently.
- Subtle animations on image upload and allergen detection to provide feedback without overwhelming the user.
